# NAND2TETRIS
Project 1(Completed), build in hardware description language (hdl) the following gates in order they are listed: 
Nand is considered to be primmitve.
Not
And
Or
Xor
Mux
DMux
Not16
And16
Or16
Mux16
Or8Way
Mux4Way16
Mux8Way16
DMux4Way
DMux8Way
Chip parts built in the project can be used to build chips later on in the project.

Project 2(Ongoing), Using the gates built in project 1 construct the follwoign chips:
HalfAdder
FullAdder
Add16
Inc16
These chips once built will be used to construct an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
